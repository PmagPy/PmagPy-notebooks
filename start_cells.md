by Lisa Tauxe, Lori Jonestrask, Nick Swanson-Hysell and Ron Shaar


This notebook demonstrates the use of **PmagPy** functions from within a  Jupyter notebook. More information is available in the PmagPy cookbook http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook.   For examples of how to use PmagPy scripts on the command line, see the [PmagPy-cli notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PmagPy/PmagPy-notebooks/master?filepath=PmagPy-cli.ipynb).

- What is **PmagPy**?  A software package for analyzing paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data using Python.
- What are paleomagnetism and rock magnetism?  See textbook at: https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/


### Importing packages and modules into the notebook
- To use the functions in this notebook, we have to   import the pmagpy modules, **pmagplotlib**, **pmag** and **ipmag** and some other handy fu\
