# PmagPy-notebooks
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the core functionality of PmagPy. They are rendered using Binder in this [interactive demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PmagPy/PmagPy-notebooks/master?filepath=PmagPy.ipynb).  Changes to the notebooks should be made in the main [PmagPy repo](http://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy), not in this one!
